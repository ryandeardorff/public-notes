This comes directly from [[Turning Approximating with Reimann Sums into Accurate Results with Limits|Turning Approximating with Reimann Sums into Accurate Results with Limits]] and [[Riemann Sums|Riemann Sums]].

--> **Integrals are sums.** <--

### Definite Integral
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx
$$

Which is the same as [[Turning Approximating with Reimann Sums into Accurate Results with Limits#^711c19|Turning Approximating with Reimann Sums into Accurate Results with Limits#^711c19]]

### Indefinite Integral
If we remove the endpoints:
$$
\int f(x)dx = F(x) + C \textcolor{gray}{\quad \leftrightarrow \quad F'(x) = f(x)}
$$
it's just [[Intro to the Antiderivative|the antiderivative]]. [[Finding Antiderivatives|Finding Antiderivatives]]
