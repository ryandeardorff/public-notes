If we have a problem where we do integration by parts twice, once originally, then again on the resulting integral-- if we choose the wrong u we can end up with essentially the following situation:
$$
y = 0 + y
$$
which isn't particularly helpful. 
This means you basically went backwards through the process, **swap the $u$ and $dv$ choice**. It should likely match the structure of the original $u$ and $dv$ choice.
