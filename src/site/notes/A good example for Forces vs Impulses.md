> When a book rests on a table, the table is pushing the book *upwards* with a *force equal to the gravity pulling it down*. If there were no force from the table to the book, then the book would sink into the table. This force is constantly pushing up on the book as long as the book is there. The speed of the book doesn't change. 
> 
> Contrast this with the way a ball bounces on the ground. The ball collides with the ground, and the ground pushes back on the ball, *accelerating the ball upward* **until** it bounces back off the ï¬‚oor with an *upward velocity*. This change in *velocity* is caused by a *force*, **but** the force acts for such a *small fraction of a second* that it is easier to think of it as *simply a change in velocity*. This is called **an impulse**.
