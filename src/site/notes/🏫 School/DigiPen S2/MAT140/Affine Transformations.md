Affine transformations have a [[🏫 School/DigiPen S2/MAT140/Linear Transformations|linear]] portion, but also an offset:
$$
\boxed{
T(\vec{x})=A\cdot\vec{x}+\vec{b}
}
$$

### The origin in any Affine Transformation:
The origin in any affine transformation maps to $\vec{b}$
$$
\boxed{
T(\vec{O}) = \vec{b}
}
$$
