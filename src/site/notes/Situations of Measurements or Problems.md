1. We know $\vec{x}$, $\vec{v}$, $\vec{a}$ at $t_{1}$ and want to know where it will be after some $\Delta{t}$
	1. This will be a case where we want [[Exploring delta time with vel. accel. and pos.|Exploring delta time with vel. accel. and pos.]]/[[Euler Integration|Euler Integration]]
2. We know $\vec{x}$ at some series of $t$ values, and want to know $\vec{v}$, $\vec{a}$
