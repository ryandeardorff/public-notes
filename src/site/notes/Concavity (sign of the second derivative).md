$f''(x) \lt 0$ = concave down
$f''(x)\gt 0$ = concave up

[[The Second Derivative|The Second Derivative]] describes which direction the slope is curving towards. This is Concavity.
You can think of it like acceleration in physics.

This expands on what we know about [[The Derivative|the first derivative]], we can observe how the slope of the original function is going up when the derivative is $\gt 0$, and going down when it is $\lt 0$, the change in that first derivative is what the second derivative models.

This is basically [[The Second Derivative Test|The Second Derivative Test]].
