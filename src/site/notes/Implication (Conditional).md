Given propositions $p$ and $q$, $p\rightarrow q$ is called an **implication** or conditional.

- $p$ is the premise or antecedent
- $q$ is the conclusion or consequence

- If $p$ is False, then $p\rightarrow q$ is True <------ this is the surprising one.
- if $p$ is T and $q$ is T, then $p\rightarrow q$ is T
- if $p$ is T and $q$ is F, then $p\rightarrow q$ is F.


$p\rightarrow q$ is logically equivalent to $\neg\,p \lor q$ ^6f291b

Simplified
$F\rightarrow F$ is T
$F \rightarrow T$ is T
$T\rightarrow T$ is T
$T\rightarrow F$ is F ^e168c9
