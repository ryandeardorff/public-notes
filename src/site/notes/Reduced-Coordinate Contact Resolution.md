This approach to contact resolution is based on calculating a set of equations based on the contacts and constraints between objects. 

There's more about it in the source linked below, but as the book states:
"Unfortunately, it is very slow, and isnâ€™t very useful in games, where speed and believability are more important than accuracy"
