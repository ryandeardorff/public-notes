$$
\vec{v} =  \frac{\Delta{x}}{\Delta{t}} \textcolor{gray}{= \frac{p_{new}-p_{old}}{dt}}
$$

Velocity is the change in position $\Delta{x}$ over the change in time $\Delta{t}$.

This will sometimes be notated in terms of [[Derivatives and Integrals for Physics|the derivative]] of position, using [[Newton's Notation for Derivatives|Newton's Notation for Derivatives]]:
$$
\vec{v} = \dot{p}
$$
