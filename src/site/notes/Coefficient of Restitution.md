$$
e = \frac{|\text{relative velocity after collision}|}{|\text{relative velocity before collision}|}
$$

It is what controls the speed at which the objects will separate after colliding, and depends on the *materials* involved in the collision. 

A coefficient of $1$ will result in no velocity lost. A coefficient of $0$ will lose all velocity.

We often call this **bounciness**.
