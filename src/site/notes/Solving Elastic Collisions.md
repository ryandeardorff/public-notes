[[Conservation of Momentum|Conservation of Momentum]]:
$$
\vec{p}_{1} + \vec{p}_{2} = \vec{p_{1}'} + \vec{p_{2}'}
$$
If the masses are constant:
$$
m_{1}v_{1}+m_{2}v_{2} = m_{1}v_{1}' + m_{2}v_{2}'
$$

Conservation of [[Kinetic Energy|Kinetic Energy]]:
$$
KE_{1}+KE_{2}= KE_{1}' + KE_{2}'
$$
In the case of a collision in 1D, we can replace the more complicated equation with:
$$
(v_{1}-v_{2}) = -(v_{1}'-v_{2}')
$$

His math from here on is gibberish, so...
