If we've got something like:
$$
\int \frac{1}{x^{2}-1} \, dx 
$$

If the denominator *can be factored* it **MUST** be factored!
You want to make sure the [[Degree of a rational function|Degree of a rational function]] is **negative**!

We can't to a trig sub here!
If we factor it we will get:
$$
\begin{align}
&= \int \frac{1}{(x-1)(x+1)} \, dx \\
\end{align}
$$

Then we have to figure out [[Partial Fractions|Partial Fractions]]
When we have degree $-1$ in our [[Partial Fractions|Partial Fractions]] we're solving, we will get constants in the numerators of the resulting fractions, which makes things quite nice.
