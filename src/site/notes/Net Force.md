The forces acting on a body [[Vector Addition|add as vectors]], this becomes the **Net Force**.

When the net force is $= 0$, then by [[Newton's Second Law of Motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the body does not accelerate. This is [[Mechanical Equilibrium|Mechanical Equilibrium]].

This is also basically [[D'Alembert's Principle|D'Alembert's Principle]].
