The **velocity** of an object is fleeting. 
If we were to measure a time at 2 locations along the travel of an object, we would get a [[Secant Line|Secant Line]], which doesn't actually describe the *immediate speed* of an object. 
Much like a [[Tangent Line|Tangent Line]]'s slope, an [[Immediate Slope|Immediate Slope]] better describes the velocity at a specific instant int time. 

That is how we can use [[The Derivative|The Derivative]] in regards to velocity.
