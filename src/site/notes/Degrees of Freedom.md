$$
\frac{C_{1}x+C_{0}}{(x-1)(x-4)} = \frac{A}{x-1}+ \frac{B}{x-4}
$$
Notice $C_{1}$ and $C_{0}$

If we were to have a $x^{2}$ in the numerator, that would be $3$ degrees of freedom.
We wouldn't want to use [[Partial Fractions|Partial Fractions]] with that case anyways (instead we'd use [[Polynomial Division|Polynomial Division]]), but it is an example of a $3rd$ degree of freedom.
