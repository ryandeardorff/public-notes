$$
v_{s}' = -e v_{s}
$$
Where $v'_{s}$ is the [[Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)|separating velocity]] after the collision, $v_{s}$ is the [[Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)|separating velocity]] before the collision, and $e$ is the constant for the [[Coefficient of Restitution|Coefficient of Restitution]].

We can do this because we assume [[Conservation of Momentum|Conservation of Momentum]].
