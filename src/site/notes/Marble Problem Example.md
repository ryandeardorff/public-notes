A bine has 5 blue, 9 red, 3 white, and 7 yellow marbles.
How many marbles have to be picked so that
a) at least 2 of the same color?
b) one yellow is picked
c) at least 4 of the same color

This is still kind of [[Pigeonhole Principle|Pigeonhole Principle]]

a) one of each color + 1 more (4 boxes-- colors) = 5
b) all the blues, reds, and whites before picking 1 yellow = 18
c) 3 (W) + $3\times 3$ (each of BRY) + 1 (B,R,or Y) = 13
