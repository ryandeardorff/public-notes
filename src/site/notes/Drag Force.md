$$
\vec{D}
$$

Force acting due to collisions with air.

For the purposes of [[PHY200 Hub - Motion Dynamics|phy200]] we will model drag as:
$$
\vec{D} = -b\vec{v}
$$
where $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the object (often in $m/s$) and $b$ is the [[Drag Coefficient|Drag Coefficient]] (often in $\frac{N\cdot s}{m}$)
