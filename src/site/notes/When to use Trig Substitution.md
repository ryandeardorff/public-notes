$$
(ax^{2}+bx + c)^{n+ \frac{1}{2}} \qquad \frac{1}{ax^{2}+bx+c}
$$
Not always applicable in the right case, but often.

### The asterisk *
$$
\int x\sqrt{1-x^{2}} \, dx
$$
We can use a [[u-substitution (integrals)|u-substitution (integrals)]] in this case instead. Even though it does match one of those
