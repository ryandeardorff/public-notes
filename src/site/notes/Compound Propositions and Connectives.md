Given propositions $p$ and $q$ define compound propositions.

| Connective | Notation | It reads | It means | Truth Value |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Negation | $\lnot \, p$ | Not $p$ | It is not the case that $p$ | T when $p$ is F |
| Conjunction | $p \wedge q$ | $p$ and $q$ | Both $p$ and $q$ | T when $p$ is T and $q$ is T |
| Disjunction | $p \lor q$ | $p$ or $q$ | $p$ or $q$ or both (inclusive or) | T when $p$ is T or $q$ is T or both are T |
| Exclusive Or | $p \oplus q$ | $p$ xor $q$ | Either $p$ or $q$, noth both | T when exactly one of $p$, $q$ is true |
| Implication | $p \rightarrow q$ | if $p$, then $q$ | $p$ implies $q$ | F when $p$ is T and $q$ is F |
| Biconditional | $p \leftrightarrow q$ | $p$ if and only if $q$ | $p$ if and only if $q$ | T when $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value. <br>*(both are true or both are false)* |
