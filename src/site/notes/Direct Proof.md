Assume $p$ is T. Show $q$ is T.


Ex: If x is an integer, then $4x+2$ is an even integer.

Def: 
If x is an integer, we say x is even if there is some $k$ also an integer so that $x=2k$. We say $x$ is odd if there is some integer $m$ so that $x=2m+1$.

$$
\dots, -4,-2,0,2,4,\dots
$$
$$
\dots,-3,-1,1,3,\dots
$$

Proof:
$4x+2$ is an integer b/c multiplying and adding integers leads to integers.
We write $4x+2 = 2(2x+1) = 2k$, where $k=2x+1$-- an integer.
Thus $4x+2$ is even.
