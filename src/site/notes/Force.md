\vec{F} = \frac{d\vec{p}}{dt}

Newton's second law states [[The Derivative|the derivative]] with respect to time of the [[Momentum|momentum]] $\vec{p}$ is the force $\vec{F}$.

If the mass does not change with time, then the derivative only affects the velocity (think [[Constant Rule for Derivatives|Constant Rule for Derivatives]]), that gives us

$
\vec{F} = m \vec{a}
$

$
\begin{align}
\vec{F} &= \frac{d}{dt} (\vec{p})  \\
&= \frac{d}{dt} (m \cdot \vec{v})  \\
&= m \frac{d}{dt}(\vec{v}) \\
\vec{F} &= m \cdot \vec{a}
\end{align}
$

This uses [[Constant Rule for Derivatives]], the definition of [[Momentum]], and the fact that [[Acceleration]] is the derivative of [[Velocity]]-- see [[Derivatives and Integrals for Physics]].
