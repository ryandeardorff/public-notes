### Intro
#### About:
Hello! I'm Ryan, welcome to my publicly available notes. This is a publicly available version of a portion of the notes I keep in my personal [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault, powered by [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). I'm always super happy when people share their research, their knowledge, or even just some general directions to look towards while solving problems. And as I've continued to solve problems of my own and explore various topics I've been starting to hit the point where I'm collecting a decent knowledgebase as well-- so if you see this, hopefully it will be useful to you.
I do a lot of research into computer science stuff, particularly games and very recently (as of writing this intro) game modding. Feel free to poke around! And also feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/ryandeardorff/public-notes) for anything that seems incorrect/wrong/misleading, I'm more than happy to fix mistakes (though I will always try to use very defensive language with anything I'm not very confident on, and source what I can). Also feel free to contribute if there's a section that you have some more info on-- I won't be complaining about more knowledge at my fingertips :)
#### How it's organized:
Currently the notes are split into folders/sections based on general topics that don't overlap a ton, but the core way I keep track of the relationships between notes is through "hub" notes-- you'll see these available in the table of contents at the top of this note. Anytime there's a specific concept/topic that I have a good number of notes related to-- there will more likely than not be a hub note for it.
