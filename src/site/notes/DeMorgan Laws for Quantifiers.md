$\neg \forall x\, P(x)$
it is not the case that for all $x$ $P(x)$ is T
there is some x for which $P(x)$ is not T ($P(x)$ is F)

$\exists x \neg \, P(x)$
$\boxed{\neg\forall x \, P(x) \equiv \exists x \neg P(x)}$

$\neg \exists x \, P(x)$
it is not the case that there is some x so that $P(x)$ is T
$P(x)$ is F for all $x$

$\forall x \neg P(x)$
$\neg\,P(x)$ is T for all $x$
