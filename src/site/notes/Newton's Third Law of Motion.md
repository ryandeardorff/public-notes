Modern View: the third law is a consequence of [[Conservation of Momentum|Conservation of Momentum]]

In Newtonian mechanics, if two bodies have momenta $\vec{p_{1}}$ and $\vec{p_{2}}$ respectively, then the total momentum of the pair is $\vec{p} = \vec{p_{1}} + \vec{p_{2}}$, and the rate of change of $\vec{p}$ is calculated as one would expect with [[The Derivative|The Derivative]]:

$$
\frac{d\vec{p}}{dt} = \frac{d\vec{p_{1}}}{dt} + \frac{d\vec{p_{2}}}{dt}
$$
