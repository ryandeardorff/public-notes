When we're solving, we often will assume [[Acceleration|Acceleration]] is constant for some period of time $T$:
$$
\begin{align}
\vec{a} = \text{constant}\\
\vec{a} = a_{x}\hat{x} + a_{y}\hat{y} + a_{z}\hat{z} \\ 
\end{align}
$$

We can use this to take advantage of [[Kinematic Equations|Kinematic Equations]]
