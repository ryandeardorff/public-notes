This is another way of formulating the [[Newton's Second Law of Motion|second law]]. It states how the sum of the forces acting on an object can be combined into one force:
$$
f = \sum\limits_{i} f_{i}
$$
We do this through [[Vector Addition|Vector Addition]].

This is the same as [[Net Force|Net Force]]
