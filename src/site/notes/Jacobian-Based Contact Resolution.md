This is an approach to contact resolution where we "calculate the exact interaction between different contacts and calculate an overall set of effects to apply to all objects at the same time."

It is more realistic, but is very time consuming. The math is complex, and can involve lots of calculations. "Most physics middleware packages and several open-source physics engines use this approach, and each has its own techniques for solving the equations and dealing with inconsistencies."
