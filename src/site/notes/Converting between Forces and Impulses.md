Impulses are measured in $kgm/s$ (also known as Newtons --$Ns$). Knowing this we see that impulses are measured in units of force multiplied by time:
$$
\frac{kgm}{s^{2}} \times s
$$
So an impulse can be represented as force applied for some specific length of time, as in:
$$
p = \vec{F}t
$$

This is supposedly useful for resting contact.
