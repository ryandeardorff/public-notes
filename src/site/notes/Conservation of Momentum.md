In a closed system, the total [[Momentum|Momentum]] remains constant.

Suppose that 2 particles interact. Using [[Newton's Third Law of Motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] the forces between them are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.
$$
F_{1} = \frac{dp_{1}}{dt} \qquad F_{2}=\frac{dp_{2}}{dt}
$$
Therefore,
$$
\frac{dp_{1}}{dt} = - \frac{dp_{2}}{dt}
$$
Or:
$$
\frac{d}{dt}(p_{1}+p_{2}) = 0
$$
