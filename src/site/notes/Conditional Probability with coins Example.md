Ex. Flip 2 coins, find prob. of 2 heads.

a) W/o additional info:
$$
\set{HH,HT,TH,TT}
$$
$P(HH) = \frac{1}{4}$

b) knowing/given 1st coin landed on H
$$
\set{HH,HT} \rightarrow P(HH|\text{info}) = \frac{1}{2}
$$
c) Knowing at least one coin landed on H.
$$
\set{HH,HT,TH}
$$
$P(HH|info) = \frac{1}{3}$
