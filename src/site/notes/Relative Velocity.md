$$
\vec{v}_{rel} = (\vec{v}_{a}-\vec{v}_{b})
$$

Relative velocity is different to that of [[Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)|Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)]], it doesn't account for what direction the velocities are moving in.

Relative velocity is just the vector component not accounting for direction of the [[Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)|Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)]]. It is a **vector value**.
