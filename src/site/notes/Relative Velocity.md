$$
\vec{v}_{rel} = (\vec{v}_{a}-\vec{v}_{b})
$$

It's where we take a [[Velocity|Velocity]] with respect to something else.
- [[Moving between reference frames for relative velocity|Moving between reference frames for relative velocity]]
- [[Limitations of Relative velocity|Limitations of Relative velocity]]

Relative velocity is different to that of [[Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)|Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)]], it doesn't account for what direction the velocities are moving in.

Relative velocity is just the vector component not accounting for direction of the [[Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)|Velocities of Separation and Approach (Closing Velocity)]]. It is a **vector value**.
