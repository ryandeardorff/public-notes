This is the github repository that is used to build https://ryansd-notes.netlify.app/, the publicly available section of my personal obsidian vault. Feel free to create an issue here if there's anything that is confusing/incorrect on the site-- as much as I try to avoid that happening. Or if there's anything that you'd like to see expanded upon, the issues and pull requests are always open.

### Custom Styling
I encourage you to change the default styling to make the site your own. Please modify the custom-style.scss when doing so to avoid future conflict when updating the template.
